            <p>We're moving closer towards a cashless society, and those sleeping rough are finding it more difficult to get enough money for their basic needs, let alone enough to get their lives up and running again.</p>
            <p>As people lucky enough to benifit from a cashless society, and not have these worries, we wanted to make sure that we can still offer a helping hand to those in need.</p>
            <p>With Phil we can all help those sleeping rough.</p>

            <p>Phil lets homeless people receive and redeem cashless donations from the public, through an app.</p>
            <p>Donors give support after discovering a person's profile and getting to know their back story.</p>
            <p>The donations are made in a token, which can be redeemed for basic essentials, like food and shelter.</p>
            <p>Phil also shows the person-in-need the nearest location they can redeem their donations.</p>
            <p>The people found on Phil are verified as needing support through partnering charities and local authorities.</p>
            <p>Using Phil raises awareness of the homeless, as donors are encouraged to share their giving on social media.</p>
